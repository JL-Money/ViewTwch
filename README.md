To run the repo, make sure you are in the ./twitchbot folder.
Open **bot.js** and replace all the "highschoolmath" with your own Twitch username.
Go onto `twitch.tv`, click your profile image at the top right, click on *Creator Dashboard*, click on *Stream Manager*.
If you have all the proper Node.js and React.js installed, just type
`node bot.js`
into the terminal.
After you see the first message pop into the chatbox, type `start` and press send.
After a while, you should see a word in the chatbox as well as attempts made in the terminal.
